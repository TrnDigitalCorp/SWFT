# SWFT
The SWFT Solution is a web-based application built and integrated into Microsoft 365 that allows scientists to view and schedule lab-based activities including by date, time and lab location. SWFT promotes collaboration and coordination between teams by predicting scheduling and occupancy conflicts, which allows team members to adjust their schedules to promote social distancing in the lab and office.
